### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a portfolio page that can seemlessly show projects I want people to see.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about javascript, particularly react and starting to set my sights on typescript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that can improve my learning. But, mainly small applications that are single feature centric.
- ðŸ“« Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-belahouane-628381b9/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've Taught thai Boxing for the past 8 years and have recently changed career.
